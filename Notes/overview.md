# General Introduction

This course is designed for non-Science/Engineering major students who desire a practical course for gaining basic computer programming skills. The primary objective is to teach students the basics of using an computational approach within their respective majors. The course will use the Python language to develop skills in problem-solving, debugging, acquiring real-world data, processing data, and interacting with and visualizing solutions. The course does not assume any prior experience with computers or programming of any kind. If you have prior experience with programming you should consider [COMP 1010](https://student.apps.utah.edu/uofu/stu/ClassSchedules/main/1204/description.html?subj=COMP&catno=1010&section=003) or [CS 1030/1410](https://handbook.cs.utah.edu/2019-2020/Prospective_Students/choosing_between_1030_1410.php) instead. Although we start by not assuming any previous experience with computers, we will quickly ramp up to advanced computing topics including data analysis and machine learning. The material will be introduced in an informal, hands-on fashion with lots of examples and guided exploration of various computational concepts. The course is roughly divided into four modules,

1.  Intro to Computational Thinking
2.  Intro to Programming (in Python)
3.  Advanced Programming Concepts and Considerations
4.  Advanced Computations (Data Analysis, Machine Learning, etc.)

# Python

Python is a programming language, and given the intended audience for this course, the focus will be on "language". We will learn to program similar to how we would learn a new language (like Spanish, French, etc.). Fairly early on we will start to 'speak' In Python, i.e., use it to solve practical problems. The primary objective will be problem solving, using the computer as a tool.

Although we will use Python as the programming language of choice, the key lesson will be on how to communicate with a computer, and the skill is readily transferable to other (programming) languages. Python is a good first choice because of its popularity across several diverse disciplines and the availability of several packages that can make it easy to perform complex tasks in a black-box fashion.

# Assignments & Projects

There will be multiple assignments during the semester as well as a final project. We will not have any exams for this course. All assignments will need to be completed individually, but you are allowed to form teams for the final project. Typically teams will be of 2 students, but I will allow larger teams if the scope of the project demands it. For both the assignments and the projects, the goal will be to use computational approaches and skills (that we have learned in class) to solve problems and analyze datasets. You will submit a report as well as the code you used to get the results presented in the report.

# Getting Help

Since we will be learning in an interactive fashion, you will frequently need to get help, either from the web or directly from the instructor or the TA. We will primarily use [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) or [Slack](https://slack.com) for this purpose. Notes, along with slides and recordings of the lectures will be available on [Canvas](/C:/Users/hsund/AppData/Local/Programs/Joplin/resources/app.asar/utah.instructure.com/ "utah.instructure.com/"). You can also meet with the instructor or the TA during their office hours. These will take place via zoom, and the details on connecting to the appropriate zoom room can be [found here](/C:/Users/hsund/AppData/Local/Programs/Joplin/resources/app.asar/zoom.md "zoom.md"). For urgent matters, you can email me directly at hari@cs.utah.edu. Finally, you can get help from your fellow students, ideally on Teams/Slack.

# Computing Resources

Since this is a course on computational thinking course, we will need access to some computing resources. Most of you already carry a pretty powerful computer with you all the time (your phones), but it might be more comfortable to use something with a larger screen and a keyboard. A tablet will suffice for most tasks, although a laptop or desktop might be more flexible, especially for the final project. For most of our assignments, we will be using [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) will will work within most browsers (so phones/tablets will work). Google collab is limited to smaller jobs, so when you are (potentially) running more complex tasks for your final project, this might not suffice, and we will need to use dedicated computing resources. For this, we will use the servers at the [Center for High Performance Computing (CHPC)](https://www.chpc.utah.edu/), in particular their [notebook](https://notebook.chpc.utah.edu/hub/login)  and [On demand](https://www.chpc.utah.edu/documentation/software/ondemand.php) servers. I will request account for everyone in the class and you are welcome to use these for these for your assignments as well instead of Google collab.
3\. Finally, you are welcome to install Python on your own machine and use it instead of the other options. I will post instructions for doing this, and the TA or I can also help you if you are unable to do this yourself.

# Course Guidelines

Behavior in the classroom All students are expected to maintain professional behavior, according to the [University of Utah Student Code](https://regulations.utah.edu/academics/6-400.php). Students should read the Code carefully and know that they are responsible for the content. According to Faculty Rules and Regulations, it is the faculty responsibility to enforce responsible classroom behaviors, beginning with verbal warnings and progressing to dismissal from class and a failing grade. Students have the right to appeal such action to the [Student Behavior Committee](https://academic-senate.utah.edu/university-committees/student-behavior-committee/).

Students are expected to engage with the instructor and classmates during class meetings. Although this course will be online, it is expected that all students attend and participate in the class. Given the relatively small size of this class (25), all students are expected to participate in every lecture.

**Working together: ** Students are encouraged to discuss assignments with fellow classmates, but each student is responsible for formulating and writing their own answer/report. **Cheating is**: sharing written or electronic work either by copying, retyping, looking at, or supplying a copy. **Cheating is not**: discussing concepts, answering questions about concepts or clarifying ambiguities, or helping someone understand how to use the class tools and software.

Students may occasionally be required to work on assignments or lab exercises in pairs. Guidelines and rules for working together will be posted with such assignments.

Cheating is taken very seriously and students must be careful not to collaborate on assignments.

Submissions are routinely checked by the course staff for signs of unauthorized collaboration.

Any student found cheating will fail the entire course.

**Students with disabilities** The University of Utah seeks to provide equal access to its programs, services and activities for people with disabilities. If you will need accommodations in the class, reasonable prior notice needs to be given to the Center for Disability and Access (http://disability.utah.edu). CDA will work with you and the instructor to make arrangements for accommodations. Accommodations cannot be given without paperwork from this office.

**Addressing Sexual Misconduct**  Title IX makes it clear that violence and harassment based on sex and gender (which includes sexual orientation and gender identity or expression) is a civil rights offense subject to the same kinds of accountability and the same kinds of support applied to offenses against other protected categories such as race, national origin, color, religion, age, status as a person with a disability, veteran’s status or genetic information. If you or someone you know has been harassed or assaulted, you are encouraged to report it to the Title IX Coordinator in the Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action, 135 Park Building, 801-581-8365, or the Office of the Dean of Students, 270 Union Building, 801-581-7066. For support and confidential consultation, contact the Center for Student Wellness, 426 SSB, 801-581-7776. To report to the police, contact the Department of Public Safety, 801-585-2677(COPS).

**Student Names & Personal Pronouns** Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s legal name as well as “Preferred first name” (if previously entered by you in the Student Profile section of your CIS account). Please advise me of any name or pronoun changes (and update CIS) so I can help create a learning environment in which you feel respected. If you need assistance getting your preferred name on your UID card, please visit the LGBT Resource Center Room 409 in the Olpin Union Building, or email bpeacock@sa.utah.edu to schedule a time to drop by. The LGBT Resource Center hours are M-F 8am-5pm, and 8am-6pm on Tuesdays.

**Student Wellness** Personal concerns such as stress, anxiety, relationship difficulties, depression, cross-cultural differences, etc., can interfere with a student’s ability to succeed and thrive at the University of Utah. For helpful resources contact the Center for Student Wellness at www.wellness.utah.edu or 801-581-7776.

**Veterans Center** If you are a student veteran, the U of Utah has a Veterans Support Center located in Room 161 in the Olpin Union Building. Hours: M-F 8-5pm. Please visit their website for more information about what support they offer, a list of ongoing events and links to outside resources: http://veteranscenter.utah.edu/. Please also let me know if you need any additional support in this class for any reason.

**Learners of English as an Additional/Second Language** If you are an English language learner, please be aware of several resources on campus that will support you with your language and writing development. These resources include: the Writing Center (http://writingcenter.utah.edu/); the Writing Program (http://writing-program.utah.edu/); the English Language Institute (http://continue.utah.edu/eli/). Please let me know if there is any additional support you would like to discuss for this class.

**Note:** This syllabus is meant to serve as an outline and guide for our course. Please note that I may modify it with reasonable notice to you. I may also modify the Course Schedule to accommodate the needs of our class. Any changes will be announced in class and posted on Canvas under Announcements.
